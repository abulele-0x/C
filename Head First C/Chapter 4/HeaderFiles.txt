I was wondering what the difference was between header files and source files.

Upon testing, I saw that I was able to add the function definition directly on the header file, but that's not 
common practice. Nevertheless, the code will compile and run anyway.

From this StackOverflow question I was able to understand it better: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3482948/what-is-the-fundamental-difference-between-source-and-header-files-in-c
